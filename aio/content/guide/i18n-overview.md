*Internationalization* (i18n) is the process of designing and preparing your application to be usable in different locales around the world.
*Localization* is the process of building versions of your application for different locales, including extracting text for translation into different languages, and formatting data for particular locales.

A *locale* identifies a region (such as a country) in which people speak a particular language or language variant.
The locale determines the formatting and parsing of dates, times, numbers, and currencies as well as measurement units and the translated names for time zones, languages, and countries.

<div class="alert is-helpful">

Create an adaptable user interface for all of your target locales that takes into consideration the differences in spacing for different languages.
