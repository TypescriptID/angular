@shortDescription `inject()` must be called from an injection context (a constructor, a factory function or a field initializer)

@description
You see this error when you try to use the `inject()` function outside of the allowed injection context. The injection context is available during the class creation and initialization. 

In practice the `inject()` calls are allowed in a constructor, a constructor parameter and a field initializer:

```typescript
@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
export class Car {
  radio: Radio|undefined;

  // OK: field initializer
  spareTyre = inject(Tyre);
  
  // OK: constructor parameter
  constructor(readonly engine: Engine = inject(Engine)) {

    // OK: constructor body
    this.radio = inject(Radio);
  }
}
```

It is also legal to call `inject` from a provider's factory:

```typescript
providers: [
  {provide: Car, useFactory: () => {
    // OK: a class factory
    const engine = inject(Engine);
    return new Car(engine);
  }}
]
```

The `inject()` calls might be wrapped in an intermediate function and will work correctly as long as a wrapper function is used in one of the allowed contexts:

```typescript
function getAndLog<T>(token: ProviderToken<T>): T {
  const instance = inject(token);

  console.log('Getting', token.toString());

  return instance;
}

@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
export class Car {
  constructor(readonly engine: Engine = getAndLog(Engine)) {
  }
}
```

Calls to the `inject()` function outside of the class creation context will result in error. Most notably, calls to `inject()` are disallowed after a class instance was created, in methods:

```typescript
@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
export class Car {

  start() {
    // ERROR: too late, the Car instance was already created and fully initialized
    const engine = inject(Engine);
    engine.start();
  }
}
```

@debugging

Work backwards from the stack trace of the error to identify a place where the disallowed call to `inject()` is located. 

To fix the error move the `inject()` call to an allowed place (usually a class constructor or a field initializer).
